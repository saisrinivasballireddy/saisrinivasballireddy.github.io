**Easter is a time for hope and renewal.** On this occasion, I'd like to share a few reflections on how we can refactor our craft. Let's begin with common misnomer patterns that quietly influence our belief systems and the environment around us.

## Journaling Your Traits

### Top‑3 Misnomer Patterns

---

### **M1: Modelling for the Paycheque**

The most common pitfall one should avoid. Chasing a pay raise as your primary motivator can **jeopardize your core beliefs**, forcing you to mold yourself to fit patterns that serve short‑term gains.

Even if it helps you climb the career ladder, this path is **not sustainable**.

At some point, monetary increases will plateau. What sustains your growth beyond that is **heroic enthusiasm and intrinsic motivation**. True mastery emerges when you **play the long game**.

### **M2: Modelling by Influence**

> *Guess who wins — charisma or knowledge?*

Don’t jump in too quickly. Context is key.

Our environment is shaped by the collective ideology of those around us. If charisma trumps substance, even an Einstein can lose a proposal.

The blessing of modern workplaces lies in being surrounded by people who **share your passion and values**.

To thrive:
- Refine your skills.
- Showcase who you really are.
- Resist fading under shadows of charismatic figures.

You may not always "win," but you'll be **rock‑solid and fulfilled**.

### **M3: Attention Syndrome**

This is a real trap.

Ask yourself:
- Am I demotivated by a lack of recognition?
- Do I still dive deep when no one’s watching?
- Do I commit even if initiatives go unnoticed?

If you're nodding to:
- **No rewards but exciting work**
- **No acknowledgements but room to grow**
- **Hidden initiatives**
- **No recognition for years**
- **Yet relentless effort**

…then pause: **opt‑in or opt‑out?**

You don’t need to rebel to lead. The **traits you cultivate now** shape your legacy and inspire those you'll mentor.

## Final Thoughts

To all emerging and future leaders:

- **Invest in long‑term character.**
- **Elevate your peers** and help them align with your vision.

If you're disconnected from your team—even with a clear vision—it's not truly a win.

When your team buys into your ideology—not because of your title but because of your **experience and integrity**—you’re not just building products; **you're building an ecosystem** that can create wonders.

You become a **hero in their journey**.
